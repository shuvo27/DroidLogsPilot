- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) must be installed and added to your system's PATH.

### üõ† Install ADB & Set Up ADB (if not already installed):

- **Windows:** [Download SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
- **macOS/Linux:**  
  ```bash
  brew install android-platform-tools  # macOS
  sudo apt install android-tools-adb   # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```
- Detailed steps for ADB installation and configuration can be found in the [ADB Installation](adbInstallation.md) documentation.
  
## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or copy the script.
2. Connect your Android device via USB and enable USB debugging.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python DroidLogsPilot.py

## üìå Notes
- This script uses adb logcat, so only logs available at runtime will be shown.
- Ensure your device is authorized and ADB is working (adb devices should list it).
